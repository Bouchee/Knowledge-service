 * FTPFileListParser defines the interface for parsing FTP file listings and

 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPFile} instances. Sometimes you will want
 * to parse unusual listing formats, in which case you would create your own
 * implementation of FTPFileListParser and if necessary, subclass FTPFile.
