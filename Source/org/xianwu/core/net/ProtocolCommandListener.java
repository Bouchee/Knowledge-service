/***
 * There exists a large class of IETF protocols that work by sending an ASCII
 * text command and arguments to a server, and then receiving an ASCII text
 * reply. For debugging and other purposes, it is extremely useful to log or
 * keep track of the contents of the protocol messages. The
 * ProtocolCommandListener interface coupled with the
 * {@link ProtocolCommandEvent} class facilitate this process.
 * <p>
 * To receive ProtocolCommandEvents, you merely implement the
 * ProtocolCommandListener interface and register the class as a listener with a
 * ProtocolCommandEvent source such as
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient}.
