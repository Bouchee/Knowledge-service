/***
 * A class used to signify the occurrence of an error in the creation of a TFTP
 * packet. It is not declared final so that it may be subclassed to identify
 * more specific errors. You would only want to do this if you were building
 * your own TFTP client or server on top of the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTP} class if you wanted more
 * functionality than the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#receiveFile receiveFile()} and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#sendFile sendFile()} methods
 * provide.
