/**
 * <p>
 * A <strong>PlugIn</strong> is a configuration wrapper for a module-specific
 * resource or service that needs to be notified about application startup and
 * application shutdown events (corresponding to when the container calls
 * <code>init</code> and <code>destroy</code> on the corresponding
 * {@link ActionServlet} instance). <code>PlugIn</code> objects can be
 * configured in the <code>struts-config.xml</code> file, without the need to
 * subclass {@link ActionServlet} simply to perform application lifecycle
 * activities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must supply a zero-argument constructor for
 * use by {@link ActionServlet}. Configuration can be accomplished by providing
 * standard JavaBeans property setter methods, which will all have been called
 * before the <code>init()</code> method is invoked.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface can be applied to any class, including an Action subclass.
